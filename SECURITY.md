**Yatra Go Security Policy**

At **Yatra Go,** we are committed to ensuring the privacy, security, and safety of our users' personal and financial information. This Security Policy outlines the security measures we implement to protect user data and ensure a secure experience when using our travel website.

**1. Data Protection and Encryption**
We use state-of-the-art encryption methods to ensure that sensitive data (such as credit card details, personal information, and passwords) is encrypted during transmission. All data exchanges between users and our servers are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.

**2. Authentication and Access Control**
To protect your account and personal data, we require strong authentication methods. Users must create secure passwords that meet the following criteria:

1. At least 8 characters long
2. Includes both upper and lowercase letters
3. Contains at least one numeric digit
4. Includes special characters (e.g., !, @, #)
5. In addition, we may implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security when accessing sensitive account areas.

**3. User Privacy and Confidentiality**
We respect your privacy and adhere to strict data protection regulations. We do not share, sell, or disclose personal information without your consent, unless required by law. Personal information collected on our website will only be used for the purpose of providing our services to you, such as booking travel, offering promotions, and providing customer support.

**4. Payment Processing and Secure Transactions**
Yatra Go uses secure, third-party payment gateways that comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS). We do not store any sensitive payment information on our servers. All payment transactions are processed securely through trusted payment providers.

**5. Security Monitoring and Audits**
Our security team conducts regular monitoring of our website for potential vulnerabilities and unauthorized access attempts. We perform periodic security audits and penetration tests to identify and address any potential weaknesses in our systems. Any identified threats will be acted upon promptly to safeguard user data.

**6. Secure User Sessions**
To prevent unauthorized access to user accounts, we use secure session management. Sessions will time out after a period of inactivity and require re-authentication for continued access.

**7. Malware and Vulnerability Protection**
Yatra Go is protected against common security threats such as malware, viruses, and other malicious software. We employ advanced security tools and firewalls to monitor and mitigate risks to the website, preventing attacks from compromising user data.

**8. Third-Party Vendors**
Any third-party services, such as travel partners, advertising networks, or payment processors, that are integrated into Yatra Go's platform are required to adhere to strict security practices. We ensure that these partners meet our security standards, including secure data handling and encryption.

**9. User Responsibility**
While we implement robust security measures, users are also responsible for maintaining the security of their accounts. We recommend the following:

- Do not share your login credentials with others.
- Log out of your account when using public or shared devices.
- Report any suspicious activity immediately.

**10. Security Incident Response**
In the event of a security breach or data compromise, Yatra Go will notify affected users promptly via email. We will provide clear instructions on how to proceed and ensure any necessary remedial actions are taken.

**11. Privacy Policy Integration**
This security policy works in conjunction with our Privacy Policy, which outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information. For more detailed information about our privacy practices, please refer to our [Privacy Policy].

**12. Continuous Improvement**
Yatra Go is committed to continuously improving our security measures. As technology evolves, we will adapt and update our security practices to address new threats and provide the highest level of protection for our users.
